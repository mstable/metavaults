/**
 * @title  VaultManagerRole , adds pausable capabilities, `onlyGovernor` can pause.
 * @notice Integrates to the `Nexus` contract resolves protocol module and role addresses.
 * For exmaple, the `Nexus` maintains who the protocol `Governor` is as well module addreesses
 * like the `Liquidator`.
 *
 * `VaultManagerRole` adds the `VaultManager` role that is trusted to set min and max parameters to protect
 * against sandwich attacks. The `VaultManager` can rebalance underlying vaults but can not
 * change the configuration of a vault. Basically, the `VaultManager` has to work within
 * the constraints of a vault's configuration. The `Governor` is the only account
 * that can change a vault's configuration.
 *
 * `VaultManagerRole` also adds pause capabilities that allows the protocol `Governor`
 * to pause all vault operations in an emergency.
